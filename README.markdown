## General info
This is an asignment for Codecademy's Full Stack Path  called "Mixed Messages".  The project consists of creating a quote generator program that ouputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program.  The message has to be made up of three random quotes.  I chose to use quotes by the nihilist phylosopher Emil Cioran.

Emil Mihai Cioran (Romanian: 8 April 1911 – 20 June 1995) was a Romanian philosopher and essayist, who published works in both Romanian and French. His work has been noted for its pervasivehilosophical pessimism, style, and aphorisms. His works frequently engaged with issues of suffering, decay, and nihilism. In 1937, Cioran moved to the Latin Quarter of Paris, which became his permanent residence, wherein he lived in seclusion with his partner, Simone Boué.
